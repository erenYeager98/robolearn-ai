This research aims to describe the types and functions of illocutionary speech acts in the conversation between Elon Musk and the moderator at TED Talk 2022 and describe the function of these speech acts. This data is in the form of sentences and clauses in conversations between Elon Musk and Chris Anderson which contain illocutionary acts. The data source was collected through observation methods using transcribing and note-taking techniques by watching and listening to video to know the context. The data is analyzed qualitatively using the theory proposed by Searle to study various types of illocutionary acts, followed by the theory proposed by Leech regarding the functions of illocutionary acts. The data analysis method used in this study is constant comparative or often called the equivalent method. The problems in this research are (1) What speech acts are contained in the conversation between Elon Musk and the moderator and (2) What is the function of each utterance. The results show that there are 4 types of speech acts in the conversation between Elon Musk and the moderator, namely (1) Assertive, (2) Directive, (3) Commissive, and (4) Expressive. Based on the function of illocutionary speech, two functions are obtained, namely (1) Collaborative function and (2) Convival function. The researcher suggests that further research needs to be carried out to understand illocutionary acts in conversation to be able to provide information and it is also necessary to pay attention to the context and situation to understand the meaning.

    "scraped": "Abstract This chapter shows how mindfulness practices (such as meditation and focused breathing exercises) benefit leaders and employees, by increasing self-awareness, reducing stress, and improving emotional regulation—leading to more authentic decision-making and effective communication, even in challenging situations. Diverse leadership groups, including youth, indigenous elders, and LGBTQ+, are viewed through the lens of mindfulness and authentic leadership.Combining mindfulness and authentic leadership can benefit middle managers by enhancing decision-making, response to challenges, and sustainable leadership. Mindfulness training improves emotional regulation, while authentic leadership increases job satisfaction.However, mindfulness and authentic leadership are not one-size-fits-all solutions, so training should be tailored to develop these skills for management.The relevance of youth leadership in community decision-making has been debated, with research emphasizing the need for youth to actively contribute to their communities. Although limited empirical evidence exists in this area, studies suggest youth develop essential skills and contribute positively through partnerships with adults. Efforts should be made to tap into the leadership potential of youth, promoting their involvement in community programs and capitalizing on their valuable assets.The leadership styles of global business leaders Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and Pete Thiel evolved over time, reflecting their core values and priorities. Their strategies and business models demonstrate an expression of their authentic leadership, shaped by unique perspectives and experiences. LGBTQ+ issues, political philosophy, and societal impact are significant considerations in their leadership journeys. A case study of a young man learning to express his more tender emotions sheds another light on individual growth.
